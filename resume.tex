    Senior Rust developer with passion for distributed systems.
    I love seeing results of my work making the world a better place.
    I enjoy collaboration and
    make sure that my solutions are
    effective, clean, well tested and documented.
    I believe that a diverse team of happy people
    is a requirement for creating great things.

        \begin{rSubsection}{Yandex N.V.}{July 2016~--~December 2020}{Developer}{}
            \item
                Designed and implemented an in-memory database
                for our monitoring service.
                Fault-tolerant, horizontally scalable,
                it uses async C++ to provide on-line access
                to the health status of thousands of systems.
            \item
                Developed an LLVM-powered C++ library
                for extracting data from logs.
                It uses map-reduce to handle hundreds of TBs of logs daily;
                it has increased parsing speed
                by 30\% and improved quality of analytics.
            \item
                Developed an efficient Python framework
                for calculating results of AB experiments using map-reduce.
                It has reduced the barrier
                to integrate AB testing into a service,
                enabling more Yandex projects to use AB\@.
